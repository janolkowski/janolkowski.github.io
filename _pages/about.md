I'm a third-year Ph.  D. student in University of Maryland advised by [Mohammad Hajiaghayi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/). My research interest splits between fault-tolerant distributed computing and mechanism design. In the area of distributed computing, my research addresses the currently critical question of latency and bandwidth of Consensus protocols. Consensus is a cool tool having its applications in databases, cloud computing, and more recently, cryptocurrencies. In my work, I investigate how tools from spectral graph theory, enhanced with a fault-tolerant design, can be used toward more scalable distributed systems. Prior joining UMD, I obtained my BSc in Mathemathics from University of Warsaw where I was interested in matrix Chernoff bounds.
